    "## Stats and probability\n",
    "1. What is a random variable?\n",
    "2. What is the expectation and variance of a random variable - how do these relate to moments?\n",
    "3. What is the difference between an estimate and an estimator\n",
    "4. Suppose you are fitting a linear model with an intercept. This model has 10000 observations and 40 columns. What is the maximum cardinality of the parameter space assuming no interactions or transformations to $X$ variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Statistical/Machine Learning\n",
    "1. What are the different types of supervised machine learning?\n",
    "2. What is a loss function?\n",
    "3. Do unsupervised machine learning methods have loss functions? \n",
    "4. What are training, validation and test sets? Why are they used?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python\n",
    "1. Lists:\n",
    "    - Generate a 10^5 list of random numbers\n",
    "    - Generate a list of lists\n",
    "    - Append two lists together using `+`\n",
    "2. `numpy` arrays:\n",
    "    - Generate an 10^5 array\n",
    "    - Using `timeit` add 1 to every element of the array using a loop and directly, compare the times\n",
    "    - Generate an array of arrays (3 x 2 x 2)\n",
    "    - Generate a diagonal matrix\n",
    "    - Using `linalg` find the inverse of [[1,2],[3,5]]\n",
    "        - Check to make sure the resulting matrix is correct by multiplying the inverse\n",
    "    - Add two matrices together\n",
    "3. Data:\n",
    "    - Generate a $5 x 5$ matrix of uniform random numbers using `np.random.random` with `np.random.seed(1234)`\n",
    "    - Transform it into a pandas dataframe \n",
    "    - Using `.iloc` select entry `(2,3)` what is it?\n",
    "    - Using `np.savetxt` save the set of numbers as a `.csv`\n",
    "    - Using `pd.read_csv` read in the numbers\n",
    "4. Functions:\n",
    "    - Define a function using that adds $x$ to very value of an array\n",
    "    - Do the same thing as above but now use `lambda` and `map`\n",
    "    - Using \n",
    "4. Plotting:\n",
    "    - Generate a random set of data\n",
    "    - Plot the data as a scatter plot with `matplotlib`"
